The Spring ATM simulation project involves creating a bank account service application that allows users to check their balance, deposit and withdraw money, and view their transaction history. The application also provides users with the option to create accounts and log in to make transactions. The deposit or withdrawal transactions can be made through a form, and the application updates the balance and transaction history in real-time. This project aims to create a secure and functional ATM simulator that can help users manage their personal banking transactions.
